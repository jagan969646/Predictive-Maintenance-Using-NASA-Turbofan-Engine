# Predictive-Maintenance-Using-NASA-Turbofan-Engine
This project applies predictive maintenance methods to the NASA CMAPSS dataset for estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines. Accurate RUL prediction is crucial in aerospace and industrial systems to avoid unexpected failures and reduce costs.
